# Flappy Bird Game

## Introduction
Welcome to the Flappy Bird Game repository!
This project is an implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using HTML/CSS JS.
It's a fun and addictive game where you control a bird to avoid obstacles and score points by flying through gaps.

## Rule :
Bird should not touch the pipes.

## How to Play
1. **Game Start**: The game starts as soon as you open the game tab.
2. **Flying the Bird**: Click on the spacebar to make the bird fly. Tap it repeatedly to control the bird's altitude.
3. **Avoiding Obstacles**: Navigate the bird carefully to avoid colliding with the pipes.
4. **Scoring**: Your score increases as you travel a greater distance without colliding with the pipes.
